Solution

	3 Jobs were used in assessed excercise.

	- Job #1: Parses through input file and extracts necessary information to perform pagerank.
		- Configuration:
			- To allow proper parsing of larger files (file size greater than a 128MB block) we 
			  sent 14 line blocks into the Mapper. This was done by changing the default delimeter to
			  "\n\n".
			- We passed the user defined timestamp through the job's configuration.
		- Mapper:
			- Signature is defined as <Object, Text, Text, Text>
			- Key: <Article_Title>
			- Value: <Outlink>
		- Reducer:
			- Signature is defined as <Text, Text, Text, Text>
			- Key: <Article_Title Page Rank> --- Page Rank is intialised as ONE
			- Value: <[Outlinks]> --- seperated by whitespace

	- Job #2: Runs iteratively and calculates the pagerank for each article title. The higher the number of iterations, the more accurate the rank.
		  This jobs mapper returns two key-value pairs. One with article title and list of outlinks and another with outlink title and the updated pagerank.
		- Configuration:
			- None
		- Mapper:
			- Signature is defined as <Object, Text, Text, Text>
			- Key1: <Article_Title>
			- Value1: <[Outlinks]>
			- Key2: <Outlink_Title>
			- Value2: <PageRank>
		- Reducer:
			- Signature is defined as <Text, Text, Text, Text>
			- Key: <Article_Title PageRank> --- separated by tabs
			- Value: <[Outlinks]> --- separated by whitespace

	- Job #3: Final job that outputs the article title and page rank pairs.
		- Configuration:
			- None
		- Mapper:
			- Signature is defined as <Object, Text, Text, Text>
			- Key: <Object>
			- Value: <Article_Title, PageRank>

Assumptions
	- Record structure is consistent i.e 14 blocks,
	- No spaces in outlinks title i.e all titles use underscore ('_') instead of spaces


Optimisation
	- To allow proper parsing of larger files (file size greater than a 128MB block) we 	
	  sent 14 line blocks into the Mapper. This was done by changing the default delimeter to "\n\n".
	- Removed self loops and filtered according to timestamps in first job. As a result it reduced amount of data read from disk and transferred over network.
	- Upon performing a pagerank MapReduce on a specific I/O pair, if the output file of the path given already exists, we remove it from the file system to avoid any I/O errors.

Modificaions:
	- None

Status
	- Our solution produces partially correct results having high precision pagerank values with a minor error of having a fraction of additional or missing records. For eg. after running 5 iterations on date 2002-01-01T00:00:00Z, it produced an output of 216 records while the correct sample output had 214 records.
